This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I realised this app for The Brink based on that model :
- https://www.figma.com/file/M5qRtcoSERzpv3EGuybCUQ/Assignment-The-Brink-Agency?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=l0WUzt2kvL8BgVJI-0.

This app was realised in around 5 hours.
This is a mobile oriented app.
I took some liberty for the size of the placeholder or the size of the section because it was not indicated in the model.

The sliders in mobile are made with 2 differents ways :
- Slider 1 : Full css
- Slider 2 : I used the JS library called Swiper (You can see the file "slider.tsx" for more detail)

I hope you will like it :D
